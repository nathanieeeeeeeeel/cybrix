# Quick Start

## Setup

To start, please invite one of our bots from the [Our Bots page](./our-bots)

After that make sure the bot has `Read Messages` and `Send Messages` permission in a channel, then run the `!setup` command.

The setup command will tell you if the bot is missing any required permissions.

### First steps

After setting up the bot you most likely want to configure join and leave channels. For that please head over [to our FAQ](./faq) to learn more.
