# My Discord Bot

My Discord Bot is a customizable bot for Discord servers, written in Python. It can be used to perform a wide range of tasks, from moderating channels to playing music to providing server statistics.

## Features

- Moderation commands to manage channels, users, and roles
- Music commands to play songs and playlists from YouTube
- Fun commands to generate memes, jokes, and trivia questions
- Server statistics commands to display user and channel activity
- Customizable configuration options for server-specific settings

## Installation

To install the bot on your server, you'll need to have Python 3.6 or later installed. You'll also need to create a new Discord application and add it to your server. Once you've done that, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Create a virtual environment for the project using `virtualenv` or `venv`.
3. Activate the virtual environment and install the required packages using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
4. Rename the `config.example.py` file to `config.py` and fill in the required information, such as your bot's token and the IDs of the channels you want to use.
5. Run the bot using `python bot.py`.

## Usage

Once the bot is up and running, you can use it by typing commands in any channel that it has access to. The default command prefix is `!`, but this can be changed in the configuration file. Here are a few example commands:

- `!help`: Displays a list of available commands.
- `!play <song>`: Plays a song from YouTube.
- `!kick <user>`: Kicks a user from the server.
